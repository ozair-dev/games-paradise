## Motivation
Built this project to get more familiar with asynchronus programming and to learn to write clearn code.

In this webapp, you can find plenty of free PC and Browser games to play.
I used the [Freetogame](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc) for fetch games data

## Getting started

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ozair-dev/games-paradise.git
cd games-paradise
npm install
```

`npm run dev` launches a server with hot reloading. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run build` builds the application to `dist`, generating two bundles for differential serving.

`npm run serve` launches a server over the previously build.

## Credits
This App uses [Freetogame](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc)'s apis to access their games database
